# Data Structures, Loops, and Control Structures

Data structures, loops, and control structures are the fundamental building blocks of any programming language, and Python is no exception. Here's a breakdown of these essential concepts:

**Data Structures:**

Data structures organize information in a specific way for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Here are some common data structures in Python:

* **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections of items enclosed in square brackets `[]`. You can store various data types within a list and access elements using their index (position).
   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana
   ```
* **Tuples:** Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be changed after creation). Tuples use parentheses `()`.
   ```python
   coordinates = (10, 20)
   ```
* **Dictionaries:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Keys must be unique and immutable (often strings or numbers), while values can be any data type.
   ```python
   person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
   print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
   ```
* **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements. Sets use curly braces `{}` but without duplicates.
   ```python
   unique_numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3}  # Set will only contain {1, 2, 3}
   ```

**Loops:**

Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. Here are some common loop types:

* **For loop:** Iterates over a sequence of elements (like a list or string).
   ```python
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)
   ```
* **While loop:** Continues executing a block of code as long as a condition is True.
   ```python
   count = 0
   while count < 5:
       print(count)
       count += 1  # Increment count by 1
   ```

**Control Structures:**

Control structures dictate the flow of execution within your program. Common examples include:

* **If statements:** Execute a code block only if a certain condition is True.
   ```python
   age = 18
   if age >= 18:
       print("You are eligible to vote.")
   ```
* **Else statements:** Provide an alternative code block if the `if` condition is False.
   ```python
   age = 15
   if age >= 18:
       print("You are eligible to vote.")
   else:
       print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")
   ```
* **Elif statements:** Allow for checking multiple conditions within an `if` statement.
   ```python
   grade = "A"
   if grade == "A":
       print("Excellent!")
   elif grade == "B":
       print("Good job!")
   else:
       print("Keep studying!")
   ```

These basic data structures, loops, and control structures allow you to write powerful and versatile Python programs. As you progress, you'll encounter more complex data structures and advanced control flow techniques.

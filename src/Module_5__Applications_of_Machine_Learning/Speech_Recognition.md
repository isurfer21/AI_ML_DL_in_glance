# Machine Learning Applications in Speech Recognition

## Speech Recognition

Speech recognition, also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), deals with converting spoken language into text. Machine learning plays a vital role in this process:

- **Acoustic Modeling:** Machine learning algorithms are trained on vast amounts of audio data with corresponding transcripts. This helps the model learn the relationship between acoustic features in speech (e.g., pitch, formants) and the underlying phonemes (basic units of sound).
- **Language Modeling:** Statistical models capture the probabilities of word sequences. This helps the model predict the most likely word sequence given the recognized sounds, improving accuracy, especially in situations with background noise or unclear pronunciations.
- **Applications:**
    - **Virtual Assistants:** Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant all rely on speech recognition for understanding user commands.
    - **Voice Search:** Dictating search queries on smartphones or using voice search engines.
    - **Automated Captioning:** Transcribing spoken content into text for accessibility or generating captions for videos.
    - **Speech-to-Text Software:** Tools for dictation, transcribing interviews or meetings.
